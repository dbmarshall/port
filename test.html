      <p>I know my way around the front-end of web development, rising to peripheral challenges that have arisen over the years, a jack of all trades when duty calls.  I've managed projects, done some SEO, and lots more.  I've touched countless different technologies, lately focusing mostly on single-page applications.</p>

      <p>On a personal level, I've volunteered with a collective that manages an open-publishing social justice news website since 2004, as well as doing my own independent reporting, photography, and videography.  When not doing all of those things, I love to unplug and head for the mountains in the winter, an avid snowboarder and powder hound. Bring it on, big sky.</p>
